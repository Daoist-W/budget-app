# Budget App Challenge 
## https://towardsdatascience.com/3-useful-projects-to-learn-python-classes-cf0076c36297

This repo contains the solution to a coding challenge I was recommended during my time at a bootcamp

## Languages used
- Python
- bash (manual usage)

## How to run (assumming familiarity with IDE's and bash)
If you would like to run this program you need the following:
* IDE (e.g. VS CODE) with python installed
* terminal (with ubuntu, powershell, python3, pytest packages)

Clone the repo to a directory of your choice 

You should 'cd' into the directory where the files are located in your terminal
and issue the following commands for manual operation 

` & C:/Python310/python.exe c:/.../app.py `

where `...` represents your directory
Be sure to confirm the correct location of your python.exe file
this should be picked up automatically by your IDE

for testing, you need to open your bash terminal to the same directory and
issue the following commands

`$ python3 -m pytest ../tests/  --cov=.`
